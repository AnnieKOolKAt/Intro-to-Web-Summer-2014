				<h1>reasons to hire me</h1><br><br>
				<ul>
					<li><h2>&#10003;&nbsp&nbspI am rationale yet inspired.</h2>I strive to create work that is adaptable, elegant solutions. My process is a logical chaos that resembles a creative method of elimination.</li><br>
					<li><h2>&#10003;&nbsp&nbspI dig deep until the hole becomes a tunnel.</h2>I have a relentless thirst to know things. I want to figure out the "why" of everything to be able make solid creative decisions. Being creative means never stop learning.</li><br>				
					<li><h2>&#10003;&nbsp&nbspYes, that pixel <em>does</em> matter.</h2>Details matter to me. I am well-versed in the principles of design; if you ask me about preferences over typefaces, I can give you a short or long answer and reasons for my choices. Equally, I am a strong believer in being pixel perfect, whether that means having clean, understandable mock-ups, whether done in Photoshop or prototyped straight into code.</li><br>
					<li><h2>&#10003;&nbsp&nbspI support "getting to the point" type of communication.</h2>Being successful in design means not only clear communication in the medium you are working in, but also in the manner in which you present your ideas. I've mastered the art of breaking down concepts, speaking in plain English and not over-fluffing ideas to get the job done.</li><br>	
					<li><h2>&#10003;&nbsp&nbspDesigner, product developer, builder, maker, etc.</h2>It doesn't matter what I am labelled, what I really do is solve problems. Sketches and ideas are worth nothing if they do not directly address the key issue relating to the business problem. With 8+ years of experience in a multitude of design and product development roles, I understand that design should not only be aesthetic, but technically proficient, address the key business goal, and in the end, it should make money.</li><br>
